/*
    An array contains 10 numbers. There is exactly one number that is repeated in this array.
    Write a program to find the duplicate number. For example, if an array with length 4 contains numbers
    {0, 3, 2, 3}, then the duplicate number is 3. For this example just change the "3" to "-1". Print out the
    original array, then the duplicate number, then the array after the duplicate is removed.

    Hint: Arrays.sort()
