/* Write the code to find the smallest sum of any two numbers in a 2 dimensional array int[][] - both of unknown length.

    Use the java.util.Random class to generate 2 Random Numbers between 1 and 30. 1 number will be the 1st dimension
    of your array (the vertical array). The second number will be the 2nd dimension (the horizontal array).

   //----------------------------------------------------------------------
    import java.util.Random; // this line must come before class declaration
    //----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Random rand = new Random();
    int  n = rand.nextInt(50) + 1;
    //50 is the maximum and the 1 is our minimum

    As Before, use the java.util.Random class to generate 100 random numbers between 1 and 22,222 and place them
    into the array. Iterate through this array two find the 2 numbers who's sum is smaller than any other.

    Expected outpust:
    Original array: <contents of original array>
    Lowest sum: <a single int, the lowest sum of any two ints in the array>
