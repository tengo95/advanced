/* Write the code to find the smallest sum of any two numbers in an int[] of unknown length.

   Use the java.util.Random class to generate 100 random numbers between 1 and 22,222 and place them
   into the array. Iterate through this array two find the 2 numbers who's sum is smaller than any other.

    //----------------------------------------------------------------------
    import java.util.Random; // this line must come before class declaration
    //----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Random rand = new Random();
    int  n = rand.nextInt(50) + 1;
    //50 is the maximum and the 1 is our minimum

   Expected outpust:
   Original array: <contents of original array>
   Lowest sum: <a single int, the lowest sum of any two ints in the array>
